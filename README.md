# SDL Hot-Reload Template

An SDL hot-reload template for game development.

## Setup

1. Install MSVC build tools (in https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/ under "Tools for Visual Studio")
2. Run `shell.bat` from the command line (this will add all of the scripts to the path)
3. Run `build.bat` from the command line

## Dev loop

1. run.bat
2. reload.bat

## Debug with Visual Studio

Simply run `debug.bat`. This will create and open a VS solution from which you can debug. Hot-reloading works here as well.
